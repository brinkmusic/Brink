# WHAT THIS FILE IS
# Serves Brink's actual web PAGES — the HTML a person sees in their browser — as
# opposed to the JSON API in the other routers (health, auth, posts). WHY this
# exists: per ADR-0013 we build the frontend in Python. Instead of a separate
# React/TypeScript app, FastAPI fills in HTML templates (in app/templates/) and
# sends whole pages to the browser. One language, one codebase.
#
# This first page ("/") proves the setup works end to end: a browser request lands
# here, we render a template styled with Brink's real look-and-feel, and the browser
# gets a proper page back. Real data + more pages come in the following steps.

# to THIS file (parent.parent = app/), so it works no matter which folder the server
# was started from.
_TEMPLATES_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "templates"

# Jinja2 is the templating tool: it takes an .html file with placeholders and fills
# them in with values we pass. `templates` is the thing we call to render a page.
templates = Jinja2Templates(directory=str(_TEMPLATES_DIR))

# A router groups related routes; app/main.py plugs it into the app.
router = APIRouter()


# When someone opens the site root ("/") in a browser, run this and return a web page.
# response_class=HTMLResponse tells FastAPI "this returns HTML, not JSON".

def home(request: Request):
    # Render templates/home.html. Jinja2Templates needs the incoming `request`, and
    # we hand it a small dictionary of values the template can drop in (here, the
    # browser-tab title). The template itself decides where each value goes.
